    Customers and tenants have valuable insight into the cleanliness and maintenance your property. And they have an experience that you may not have as the manager. Thus, it is important for you to get feedback from them to improve your customer experience.

    Ensure that customers and tenants have a channel to give feedback or complaints on the cleaning conditions of the facility. Also, set up feedback channels for your employees and cleaning staff.
    
    Make sure that customers and tenants know about this channel. They should know how to access and how to file their feedback. 
    
    Use the feedback and data you gather from these channels to identify which areas of the facility have the most issues. Then you can work to resolve any issues and improve problem areas.
