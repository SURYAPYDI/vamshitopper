    Our products are designed in a way to make assembly easy. But if you don't have the time or the desire to assemble the furniture yourself, you can also make a furniture assembly appointment. The handymen will assemble your furniture in a skilled, safe and quick way. The only thing left for you to do? Make sure your products are in the right room.

 

    There are two ways to make a Furniture Assembly appointment
    
    You can easily make an online appointment via WIFY or Urban Company, or with an IKEA employee at one of our stores.
    
    Make an online appointment via our assembly partners
    WIFY & Urban Company is an online platform for assembly by independent service providers. Via this platform, you can make an appointment with a professional handyman that suits your personal needs.
    
    Assembly can be done quickly: sometimes even on the same day or the day after.
    Have you started assembling IKEA furniture yourself but the results are not what you expected? Choose a handyman to finish the assembly for you.
    You can choose to dispose of the packaging yourself or have this done for you.
