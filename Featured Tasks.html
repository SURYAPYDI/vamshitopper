    Building maintenance refers to activities undertaken to ensure buildings and their utility systems are safe, habitable, and in working order. While building maintenance shares the same goals as property maintenance, it doesn’t always include caring for the environment surrounding buildings. It’s worth mentioning that the term general building maintenance is often confused with property maintenance. While there is an overlap between the responsibilities, there are some key differences.

The most common building maintenance activities include:

Cleaning surfaces such as gutters, handrails, windows, floors, and bathrooms

Undertaking repairs on assets such as elevators and HVACs

Maintaining utility systems such as plumbing and electrical services

Ensuring the doors, roofs, walls, and windows are in excellent condition

Building maintenance activities are often categorized by level of priority. For example, emergency repairs are prioritized over less critical tasks because of time and budgetary constraints. Workers involved in building maintenance include janitors, facility managers, and maintenance technicians. 

General maintenance technicians work full-time on properties, practicing reactive maintenance, emergency maintenance, and preventive maintenance.
